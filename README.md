## Overview
<hr>

Tourism has turned out to be an economic booster contributing to the economic development of many countries over the last few decades. People see holidays as a necessity, and not as luxury in the present scenario. Tourism calls for coordination and cooperation between travel agents, tour operators, and tourists. Tourism has a few major elements − destinations, attractions, sites,
accommodation, and all ancillary services. The need for a robust and dynamic tour management application has been around since the advent of the tourism concept.


## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
<hr>

The main objective of the Tourism Management System is to manage the details of Customer, Hotel Booking, Cancellation and Tourism places. It manages all the information about Users, Hotel, Packages etc. The project is totally built at administrative end and thus only the administrator is guaranteed the access to the backend database. The purpose of this project is to build an application program to reduce the manual work for managing Tourists, Booking, Places etc. 

* This application will help in accessing the information related to the travel to the particular destination with great ease. The users can track the information related to their tours with great ease through this application. The travel agency information can also be obtained through this application.

* Through this system, the propose system is highly automated and makes the travelling activities much easier and flexible. The user can get the very right information at the very right time. This system will include all the necessary fields which are required during online reservation time. This system will be easy to use and can be used by any person. The basic idea behind this project is to save data in a central database which can be accessed by any authorize person to get information and saves time and burden which are being faced by their customers. 

* Administrator can access and modify the information stored in the database of this system, this includes adding and updating of details, and it will give accurate information and simplifies manual work and also it minimizes the documentation related work. Provides up to date information. Finally booking confirmation notification will be send to the users. 
* Tourists can register by providing personal details, make new reservation and book only one hotel and package and can make cancellation.

* This project is designed with SQL Server as back end. All the data will be stored in the server and in case of any data losing situation, a backup will be available by this server. The details related to every aspect of the tourist will be available separately. The admins just have to click once and all the details will be available to them.

## `CONCLUSION AND FUTURE ENHANCEMENT `
<hr>
 
Tourism is currently recognized as a global industry which is growing at a high rate like any other industry. Access to relevant and accurate information is at the heart of tourism. Here, the proposed project on Tourism Management System tries to bridge the gap by noting what a tourist perceives as relevant. Hence, the aim of this project entails the design and implementation of a platform that will assist tourists in gaining access to travel to various tourist locations. The project also helped to provide knowledge about the latest technology used in developing web enabled application and client server technology that will be great demand in future.
 It is worth mentioning that this project work is open for further enhancement, with the expectation that it becomes more robust and better enhanced; covering every single tourist sites. For a modified system, the user needs to just login into the application and can find the routes, costs, hotels, adventure sports, transportations and book immediately and complete the booking process for a successful transaction. <br>
In the aspect of tourism, Internet and web technologies have made more readily available information on tourist locations, accommodations, transportation, shopping, food, festivals, and other attractions, thus improving the whole tourism experience. 
The process of the system we can consider here, can maintain the databases of the system. We can insert to the databases and retrieve all the information. <br>
The main aim of this project is to help the tourists to manage their trip. It makes all operation of the tour company easy and accurate. The standalone platform makes tourism management easy by handling requests and providing servers for the customers located at different parts of the various cities. Different modules have been incorporated in this project to handle different parts and sector of the tour management field.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
